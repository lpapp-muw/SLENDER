# SLENDER
Repository for the SLENDER project, aiming to build a convolutional Distance-Encoding Biomorphic-Informational Neural Network (cDEBI-NN) scheme with novel interpretability approaches. Please note that the SLENDER project is currently under review. At this moment, data shown on this repository is to serve additional information for the review process. As the project progresses, this repository will also be updated.

# Preliminary Study
We conducted a preliminary study on fully-connected DEBI-NN network schemes. To access the peer-reviewed manuscript of our preliminary study, see:
