# SLENDER
Repository for the SLENDER project, aiming to build a convolutional Distance-Encoding Biomorphic-Informational Neural Network (cDEBI-NN) scheme with novel interpretability approaches. Please note that the SLENDER project is currently under review. At this moment, data shown on this repository is to serve additional information for the review process. As the project progresses, this repository will also be updated with source code, binaries, data and publication access links as well as with any additional metadata required to replicate our results and to use our tools.

# Preliminary Study
We conducted a preliminary study on fully-connected DEBI-NN network schemes. To access the peer-reviewed manuscript of our preliminary study, see:

L. Papp, D. Haberl, B. Ecsedi et al., DEBI-NN: Distance-encoding biomorphic-informational neural networks for minimizing the number of trainable parameters. Neural Networks (2023), doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2023.08.026.

**Note**: The github repository for the fully-connected DEBI-NN is located here: https://github.com/lpapp-muw/DEBI-NN

This repository does not contain source code, which will be available here once the SLENDER project departs.

# DEBI-NN in Action
For a video example of how a DEBI-NN is trained over an open-source tabular data, see:

# Trainable Parameter Count Comparison

Trainable parameter count comparison is detailed in file: Parameter comparison-SLENDER.xlsx. Refer to the individual explanations on each table in the spreadsheet to interpret how individual network schemes were established and how the calculations are performed.

# Interpretability Questionnaire

For the preliminary interpretability questionnaire of the SLENDER project refer to Preliminary Interpretability Questionnaire-SLENDER.docx. This file conains the planned questions the SLENDER project shall utilize to evaluate the added value of any interpretability approach the project utilizes for cNNs and cDEBI-NNs.
